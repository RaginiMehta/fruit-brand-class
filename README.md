# # Juice Brand Project

This repository contains **4 files** that together demonstrate a simple juice brand project.

Each file is responsible for a specific part of the project logic and structure, such as layout, styling, and functionality.  
Together, they work to represent and organize the core features of the juice brand.

This project is intended for learning and practice purposes.

The files are : 

1. ```impNph.ipynb``` : This script is used for division of the data between impedance and phase values, based on timestamps of data collection, on the basis of classes and eventually into real and imaginary data.

2. ```LDA.ipynb```: This script is used for analysis of data, with the creation of LDA Plots on the different data collected, and furthermore on the KNN Classification and analysis.

3. ```NyquistPlot.ipynb```:
